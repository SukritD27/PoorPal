## Responsibilities

 The addition of the FriendsList and FriendRequest features to our web application represents a significant enhancement, akin to functionalities seen in platforms like PayPal or Venmo. These features allow users to manage their social connections within the app, including viewing current friends, accepting or declining friend requests, and initiating transactions. The development approach was centered around creating React components that interact with the back-end via API calls. The FriendsList component was designed to display a list of friends and handle friend requests in a user-friendly interface, integrating seamlessly with the existing front-end architecture.

  My primary responsibility was to work on the transaction feed page. This feature required minimal work on the backend to correctly fetch transactions for a user.

  I created the wireframe for the frontend on most pages and set up a MVP for the user interface. Using Bootstrap, I made components for the landing page, transaction feed, and the send/request page.

  In addition, I also had to make sure that the backend was working properly since it was migrated from my version of Homework 2. A part that was particularly frustrating was to fix the parser that failed to parse HTTP requests because of carriage return characters.

  Most of the work required was to ensure that the data from the backend can be displayed properly. The most difficult part was working with frontend components and ensuring that the requesting user is authorized to make requests.
