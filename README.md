 The addition of the FriendsList and FriendRequest features to our web application represents a significant enhancement, akin to functionalities seen in platforms like PayPal or Venmo. These features allow users to manage their social connections within the app, including viewing current friends, accepting or declining friend requests, and initiating transactions. The development approach was centered around creating React components that interact with the back-end via API calls. The FriendsList component was designed to display a list of friends and handle friend requests in a user-friendly interface, integrating seamlessly with the existing front-end architecture.
